Tools that I recommend you to use in developing any PHP applications:

### Virtualize your PHP development environment

1. Install Oracle [Virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for virtualizing development environments.

2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to create and configure lightweight and portable development environments.

3. Install [putty](http://www.putty.org/) for ssh into the development machine you are going to have. 

4. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and use GitBash

5. Install laravel/homestead:
For this follow the steps shown in this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0veZd9mtGc).

 Or,

 Install [Larvel Homestead](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/homestead) for virtual PHP application development environment.
